Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working with [Rebecca E. Taylor](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/taylor-rebecca.html) in the Microsystems and Mechanobiology Lab ([MMBL](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bex/pages/people/)) and [Jonathan Cagan](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/cagan-jonathan.html) in the Integrated Design Innovation Group ([IDIG](https://www.cmu.edu/me/idig/)) on applying generative design strategies (i.e. shape grammars and simulated annealing) to automate and optimize the design of DNA origami nanostuctures. I graduated from Texas Tech University where I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am a Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate ([NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/)) Fellow (2021). My research interests revolve around: 
structural and mechanical biology, and machine learning modeling. I am specifically interested in leveraging machine learning models to make predictions about the structural and mechanical behavior of biological complexes.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
