	abstract = {Structural DNA nanotechnology involves the design and self-assembly of DNA-based nanostructures. As a field, it has progressed at an exponential rate over recent years. The demand for unique DNA origami nanostructures has driven the development of design tools, but current CAD tools for structural DNA nanotechnology are limited by requiring users to fully conceptualize a design for implementation. This article introduces a novel formal approach for routing the single-stranded scaffold DNA that defines the shape of DNA origami nanostructures. This approach for automated scaffold routing broadens the design space and generates complex multilayer DNA origami designs in an optimally driven way, based on a set of constraints and desired features. This technique computes unique designs of DNA origami assemblies by utilizing shape annealing, which is an integration of shape grammars and the simulated annealing algorithm. The results presented in this article illustrate the potential of the technique to code desired features into DNA nanostructures.},

	title = {A formal approach for automated generation of {DNA} origami designs},
	abstract = {Over recent years, structural DNA nanotechnology has witnessed the unveiling of transformative tools that have
advanced the design of DNA origami nanostructures. Currently, most structures are manually designed from the
bottom-up which starts at the base scale to design large DNA assemblies. However, the complexity of the manual
process often limits designs to simple structures and the slow design process limits the number of feasible designs
for comparison. Such limitations spurred the creation of automated tools that utilize an approach that is
fundamentally top-down by starting with an outline of the desired configuration and walking backwards to define the
DNA base sequence to form the large DNA assembly. However, these automated tools also limit the design space
by requiring the designer to fully conceptualize the design before implementation. A formal approach to generate
designs from scratch would greatly advance the design of DNA origami structures. We introduce such a formal
approach that utilizes generative optimization strategies to design DNA origami nanostructures through automation.
This is achieved through shape annealing [1], which couples simulated annealing [2], a stochastic optimization
method, with shape grammars [3], which use a formal rule-based method to define the generation of geometric
shapes. Shape annealing optimally directs the generation of shapes by controlling the selection and
implementation of transformative shape rules. This approach addresses the limitations previously stated by
computing optimally directed scaffold routing patterns only with a set constraints and desired properties. During the
annealing schedule, scaffold segments are selected in order to optimally grow the scaffold length for a desired
function. As an initial demonstration of the method's capability to generate optimally driven scaffold routing
patterns, we use three distinct polyhedral meshes as a constraint for a filling and coating application. By utilizing
constraints to control the generation of the scaffold, this approach is fundamentally a hybrid top-down and bottom
up design process. The results in Figure 1 illustrate the potential of shape annealing to code desired properties into
DNA origami designs.},

In the recent years, the field of structural DNA nanotechnology has advanced rapidly due
to transformative design tools. Although these tools have been revolutionary, they still bear two
key limitations. Base-level design tools push users towards conceptually simpler extrusion-style
designs due to the complexity of manually constructing more irregular geometries. This limitation
gave rise to the development of powerful automated and semi-automated tools for generating
wireframe [1] and solid extrusion-based systems [2]. However, these new tools still limit users to
fully conceptualize their design and are therefore unable to assist with practical challenges
encountered in DNA origami design such as efficient use of the scaffold.
We have previously shown that generative optimization strategies can be used to design
DNA origami nanostructures through automation [3]. In this work, we show how this method can
be used to implement coating-type designs for arbitrary input shapes that use differing amounts
of scaffold. This is accomplished by employing a shape annealing algorithm [4], which creates a
language of DNA nanostructures with shape grammars
[5] and drives designs from the language towards a
desired configuration using simulated annealing [6].
Shape grammars use a formal rule-based method to
define the relationship between geometric shapes while
simulated annealing is a stochastic optimization
technique. This formal approach addresses the
limitations from current automated and semi-automated
tools by generating complex DNA origami designs in an
optimally driven way only with a set of boundaries and
desired characteristics. In previous work, this new
approach was demonstrated by directing the scaffold
routing pattern to fill or coat the walls of distinct
polyhedral meshes as boundaries. Here, we present,
a more refined approach that addresses the quality,
thickness, and scaffold utilization of generated
coatings.},
